# articleLapse
Creates a time lapse any web page visualizing the way it changes. 



In the context of jernalism the word artical was used to be a good word for 
words that were stamped into a physical object. An article of clothing say a pair of pants 
can not magicaly turn into a dress, and in the same way when a type setter create set words to thousands of new papers the articals with could not change. 

Now we use the word Artical to describe something that by the nature of its medium is different, 
web pages. In doing so we might fallsy asume that were all reading the same "Article" when given the same link. 

If I read and article at noon tytled " tommys suporters climbe gate " and then send you a link to the article 
saying that I really like the title, then the reporter changes the articls tytle to " tommys suporter dump beer into marhta back yard" at 1 pm  and at 2:00 pm you read the article and say reply back to me that you dont like how they depicted people as durunks in that articl .... then we are in a hell of a bind arnt we. 

changing an article out from under the reader with no record of doing so is dangerus and ruins any posibuility of 
the article leading to cohesive conversation.  

This kind of medeling happens in comment sections as well.. replying to a comment which is deleted at a later date. 
or having only some comments that fit the view of the modortor showen. 

plato rimids us to bring our brothers out side of the cave before debating the world. 
articls that change out from under the reader turn the value of public discoruse into the 
destruction of unknown deceptions. 

Magical things are easy to do in vertual realliy, the chanenge becomes how to have a cohesive vitual reality. 


one thing we can do is keep a history of what changes are being made to and article
and another thing we can do is come up with and interface that is makes it easy for everyday people to check that 
they are looking at the same article. 

I think that an md5 check sum that is translated into word would be a good start. 
one could say check out this article link = "url" checksum = bob frank alpha 
and your freind could get the article and say nope checksum is not bob frank alpha 

This code is far more valuble if mulipule entitys can run it and check that they agree on the history of a site. 
This code creates a record of history and any one will mall intent could modifin the record of history in an effort to control the future. 
There for its important that as many people as posible can participate in the creation of the record. 
a block chain of the check sums of this records set history in digial stone, the more people that agree at the time of the recording the more likely were setting the truth into that stone. 

digital stone ... the most fragile stone on earth that canot even survie a solar flair.
